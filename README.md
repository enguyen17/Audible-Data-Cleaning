# Audible Data Cleaning Project

This repo includes a Jupyter Notebook detailing my process cleaning data from this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehangsude/audible-dataset/data) found on Kaggle. 
The dataset used was collected using a web scraping script that can be found on the original website and contains information on audiobooks such as author names, price, duration etc.
The goal for this project is to analyze any trends that may be useful for the audiobook market, with the first step to clean and transform the dataset.
